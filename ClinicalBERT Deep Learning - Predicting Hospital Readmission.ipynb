Therefore, discharge summaries are not actionable since doctors cannot intervene when a patient has left the hospital. Models that dynamically predict readmission in the early stages of a patient's admission are relevant to clinicians...a maximum of the first 48 or 72 hours of a patient's notes are concatenated. These concatenated notes are used to predict readmission.\"[pg 12](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05342.pdf)\n",

    "Boag et al. (2018) study the performance of the bag-of-words model, word2vec, and a Long Short-Term Memory Network (lstm) model combined with word2vec on various tasks such as diagnosis prediction and mortality risk estimation. Word embedding models such as word2vec are trained using the local context of individual words, but as clinical notes are long and their words are interdependent (Zhang et al., 2018), these methods cannot capture long-range dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clinical notes require capturing interactions between distant words.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this work, they develop a model that can predict readmission dynamically. **Making a prediction using a discharge summary at the end of a stay means that there are fewer opportunities to reduce the chance of readmission. To build a clinically-relevant model, we define a task for predicting readmission at any timepoint since a patient was admitted.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Medicine suffers from alarm fatigue (Sendelbach and Funk, 2013). This\n",
    "means useful classification rules for medicine need to have high precision (positive predictive value).\n",

    "A clinical note input to ClinicalBert is represented as a collection of tokens. In ClinicalBert, a token in a clinical note is computed as\n",
    "the sum of the token embedding, a learned segment embedding, and a position embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-training ClinicalBERT\n",
    "The quality of learned representations of text depends on the text the model was trained on. BERT is trained on BooksCorpus and Wikipedia. However, these two datasets are distinct from clinical notes (where jargon and abbreviations are common). Also clinical notes have different syntax and grammar than common language in books or encyclopedias. It is hard to understand clinical notes without professional training.\n",

    "##  Empirical Study II: 30-Day Hospital Readmission Prediction\n",
    "Before the author even evaluated ClinicalBERT's performance as a model of readmission, **his initial experiment showed that the original BERT suffered in performance on the masked language modeling task on the MIMIC-III data as well as the next sentence prediction tasks. This proves the need develop models tailored to clinical data such as ClinicalBERT!**\n",

    "\n",
    "He finds that computing readmission probability using Equation (3) consistently outperforms predictions on each subsequence individually by 3–8%. This is because\n",
    "1. some subsequences (such as tokens corresponding to progress reports) do NOT contain information about readmission, whereas others do. The risk of readmission should be computed using subsequences that correlate with readmission risk, and **the effect of unimportant subsequences should be minimized**. This is accomplished by using the maximum probability over subsequences. \n",
    "2. Also noisy subsequences mislead the model and decrease performance. So they also include the average probability of readmission across subsequences. This leads to a trade-off between the mean and maximum probabilities of readmission in Equation (3).\n",
    "3. if there are a large number of subsequences for a patient with many clinical notes, there is a higher probability of having a noisy maximum probability of readmission. This means longer sequences may need to have a larger weight on the mean prediction. We include this weight as the n/c scaling factor, with c adjusting for patients with many clinical notes.\n",
    "Empirically, he found that c = 2 performs best on validation data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation\n",
    "For validation and testing, 10% of the data is held out respectively, and 5-fold cross-validation is conducted. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each model is evaluated using three metrics:\n",
    "1. AUROC\n",
    "2. Area under the precision-recall curve\n",
    "3. Recall at precision of 80%: For the readmission task, false positives are important. To minimize the number of false positives and thus minimize the risk of alarm fatigue, he set the precision to 80% (in other words, 20% false positives out of the predicted positive class) and use the corresponding threshold to calculate recall. This leads to a clinically-relevant metric that enables us to build models that control the false positive rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Models\n",
    "* The training parameters are the entire encoder network, along with the classifier **`W`**\n",
    "* Note that the data labels are imbalanced: negative labels are subsampled to balance the positive readmit labels\n",
    "* ClinicalBert is trained for one epoch with batch size 4 and ee use the Adam optimizer learning rate 2 × 10−5\n",
    "*  The ClinicalBert model settings are the same as in Section 3.\n",
    "* The binary classifier is a linear layer of shape 768 × 1\n",
    "* The maximum sequence length supported by the model is set to 512, and the model is first trained using shorter sequences.\n",

    "###  Readmission Prediction With Early Clinical Notes\n",

    "> **Note** that readmission predictions from a model are not actionable if a patient has been discharged. \n",
    "\n",
    "**24-48h**\n",
    "* In the MIMIC-III data, admission and discharge times are available, but clinical notes do not have timestamps. This is why the table headings show a range; this range shows the cutoff time for notes fed to the model from early on in a patient’s admission. For example, in the 24–48h column, the model may only take as input a patient’s notes up to 36h because of that patient’s specific admission time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**48-72h**\n",
    "* For the second set of readmission prediction experiments, a maximum of the first 48 or 72 hours of a patient’s notes are concatenated. These concatenated notes are used to predict readmission. Since we separate notes into subsequences of the same length, the training set consists of all subsequences within a maximum of 72 hours, and the model is tested given only available notes within the first 48 or 72 hours of a patient’s admission.\n",
    "* For testing 48 or 72-hour clinical note readmission prediction, patients that are discharged within 48 or 72 hours (respectively) are filtered out.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretable predictions in ClinicalBert\n",
    "* ClinicalBert uses several self-attention mechanisms which can be used to inspect its predictions, by visualizing terms correlated with predictions of hospital readmission.\n",
    "    * For every clinical note input to ClinicalBert, each self-attention mechanism computes a distribution over every term in a sentence, given a query.\n",
    "    * **A high attention weight between a query and key token means the interaction between these tokens is predictive of readmission**.\n",
    "    *  In the ClinicalBert encoder, there are 144 self-attention mechanisms (or, 12 multi-head attention mechanisms for each of the 12 transformer encoders). \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Preprocessing\n",
    "ClinicalBert requires minimal preprocessing:\n",
    "1. First, words are converted to lowercase and\n",
    "2. line breaks are removed\n",
    "3. carriage returns are removed. \n",
    "4. De-identified the brackets \n",
    "5. remove special characters like ==, −−\n",
    "\n",
    "* The SpaCy sentence segmentation package is used to segment each note (Honnibal and Montani, 2017).\n",
    "    * Since clinical notes don't follow rigid standard language grammar, we find rule-based segmentation has better results than dependency parsing-based segmentation.\n",
    "    * Various segmentation signs that misguide rule-based segmentators are removed or replaced\n",
    "        * For example 1.2 would be removed\n",
    "        * M.D., dr. would be replaced with with MD, Dr\n",
    "    * Clinical notes can include various lab results and medications that also contain numerous rule-based separators, such as 20mg, p.o., q.d.. (where q.d. means one a day and q.o. means to take by mouth.  \n",
    "        *  To address this, segmentations that have less than 20 words are fused into the previous segmentation so that they are not singled out as different sentences."

Since the square of recent gradients tells us how much signal we’re getting for each weight, we can just divide by that to ensure even the most sluggish weights get their chance to shine. Adam takes that idea, adds on the standard approach to momentum, and (with a little tweak to keep early batches from being biased) that’s it!...We should use **weight decay** with Adam, and not the L2 regularization that classic deep learning libraries implement [[fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/2018/07/02/adam-weight-decay/#understanding-adamw-weight-decay-or-l2-regularization)].\n",
